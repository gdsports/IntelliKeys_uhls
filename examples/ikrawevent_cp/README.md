# CircuitPython IntelliKeys Example using binary protocol

See the Arduino ikrawevent example for details on the binary protocol.

On Trinket M0 and other non-Express boards, add adafruit_bus_device to lib
directory. This is to get the uart object.

Tested on Trinket M0 running "Adafruit CircuitPython 4.1.0-rc.1 on 2019-07-19; Adafruit Trinket M0 with samd21e18".
